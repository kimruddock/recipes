Ingredients:
- 300g self-raising flour
- 100g caster sugar
- pinch of salt
- 150g unsalted butter
- 150g sultanas
- 100g soft dried apricots, cut into small pieces
- 120g marzipan chopped into 1cm cubes
- 2 large eggs
- 150ml milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

To finish:

- 1 tablespoons apricot jam melted in a little water
- 2 tablespoons flaked almonds

Directions:
1. Grease and bottom line a 900g/2lb loaf tin. Pre-heat oven: gas mark 4/350F/180C/Fan 160C.
2. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Cut the butter into pieces and rub into the flour, or mix in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
3. Stir in the sugar, add apricots and sultanas and mix. Beat the eggs with the milk and vanilla in a separate bowl.
4. Stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients to make a fairly stiff batter. Spoon one third of the batter into the tin. Spread evenly and top with half the marzipan. Cover with half of the remaining cake batter and the rest of the marzipan, then spread the last of the batter over the top.
5. Gently knock the tin to remove any air pockets. Bake for 60-75 minutes depending on your oven, testing with a skewer to see when the cake is done. Test in more than one place to avoid the marzipan.
Run a knife round the edge of the tin when the cake comes out of the oven, then leave to cool for  15 minutes before turning out.
6. Warm the jam and brush on top to glaze, then sprinkle with flaked almonds to finish.
